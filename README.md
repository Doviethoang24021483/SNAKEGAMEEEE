RedmiGame

Welcome to RedmiGame, a classic snake game with a musical twist! üêçüéµ Developed in C++ using SDL2, this game challenges you to guide the snake to eat musical notes while enjoying sound effects and a special Symphony Mode.

Game Overview

In RedmiGame, you control a snake that moves around the screen to eat musical notes. Each note you eat correctly increases your score, and eating a sequence of notes in the right order triggers the Symphony Mode, where you must collect 20 golden notes within a time limit to win. Be careful not to crash into the walls or the snake's own body, or the game will end!
